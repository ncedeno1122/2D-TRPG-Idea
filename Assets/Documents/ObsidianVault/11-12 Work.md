We're in VEGAS baby and frankly I'm a bit uninterested. This is definitely a place for people who are not me LOL, I feel really weird in a place that seems to value vanity and superficiality so much, but I'm probably reading too much into it. In any case, I've done a couple of different things so far and I need to think about more.

So in my way to implement the `ItemInventoryState` somewhat, I'd made some UI for the items, and some scripts that I'll use for those. Basically, a main UI Panel works with scripts that represent the individual ItemPanels which will help us determine what's selected, what to equip, all that junk eventually.

As well, I'd been working on a way to serialize and expose IItem members: specifically, in the case where I couldn't see or show (in a nice, family-friendly way) the Inventory Array because they were IItem members instead of direct children of ItemData.
My solution was to make BattleItems inherit directly from the ItemData instead of ScriptableObject and also implement the IBattleItem interface. It helps me tie the classes tighter together, which makes sense, and rewards me with a good Inventory that I can see in the Inspector. That said, I wonder if I can organize the `CharacterUnitScript` editing workflow better with a custom editor script... That however, is a big want and not so much a need at the moment.
