I'm just really glad that I've made something that's not terrible, and that actually seems to work well. There'll be a lot of things to refactor, as always, but at least it's working here in the short term and not in the most inefficient way.

In any case, I have to see about what exactly I want to do next. The tasks I have to do all seem pretty hefty, but this all seemed kinda crazy before I actually went and did it.

That said, I've begun working a little bit on the InventoryPanel that I'll use for whatever I end up calling the item/inventory state. Perhaps `ItemState`? But that's too vague I think. Perhaps `ItemInventoryState` is good. 

I'll need to implement the selection-style logic again here. I wonder if there's a better way or not. Either way, for a Fire Emblem-style menu, you need to be able to select items, then be able to to perform certain actions, like Equipping them if equippable, Swapping their item slots with anothers, and Using the items if they're usable.

When you click on a button or otherwise select an ItemPanel, it pulls up the action submenu and all that.
