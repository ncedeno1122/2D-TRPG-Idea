# TODO (10/21)
It'd been a bit since I worked on this project, so I'm using this notepad to jot down some ideas of what I have to do next.
Obsidian appears to be a better Boostnote, that has Git support, so this might be really cool :D! Honestly I'm not super sure about the utilities of this new tool, but I'll have to just  get used to it.
As well, I finally got through my first playthrough of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, and I have some fresh context to work with. Unfortunately, it's reading week at school and I couldn't prioritize this game over my work or anything like that.

So far, this markdown seems pretty cool, I have to remember all the formatting options this offers.

## In any case,
### Detecting TileEntities
One of the things that I have to implement still is the detection of other TileEntities and beings on Tiles. When I click on a Tile, I want to be able to pull up sufficient information about it; what type the Tile is, what's on the Tile, maybe *who's* on the Tile, and more. This is all really important so I don't end up being able to stand on units or attack or anything like that.

### Generating the TileActionMenu
I want to be able to pull up the context menu with a few options. Most notably, to attack enemy units, heal friendly units, and more. This is why I need to first Detect TileEntities and get some of that structure down.
